# React Pipeline Forge (Frontend Demo)

A React-based pipeline builder application.

## Frontend Only Deployment

This project is deployed as a standalone frontend application. 
The backend submission logic is **simulated** for demonstration purposes since the backend service is not deployed.

## Project Structure

- `frontend/`: React application created with Create React App.

## Running Locally

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Features

- **Pipeline Builder**: Drag and drop nodes to create pipelines.
- **Frontend Demo Mode**: Simulates backend response for DAG analysis when the backend is unavailable.
